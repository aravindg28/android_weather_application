WEATHER APPLICATION:

The weather application allows user to enter a city and get the weather details by clicking the ‘Get Weather’ button.
(NOTE: By default, the app loads the weather details of Halifax while being loaded for the first time). 

The app displays certain useful details such as the city name, temperature (including minimum and maximum temperature), weather description,
humidity and cloud percentage and finally the indication of day/night. 

One of the major highlights of the application is its ability to dynamically change the background according to the weather condition. 
This allows user to know the weather condition of the requested city without even looking at the weather description.

The application also has a ‘refresh’ feature using which the user can refresh the weather details of a city which was already requested.
